## Java practice code katas
In martial arts a kata is an exercise where you repeat a form many times making little improvements in each.  
This is my attempt at programming katas in Java.  
The exercises here are:  
- Fibonacci series  
  - Consists of a sequence of numbers in which each successive number in the 
    sequence is obtained by adding the two previous numbers in the series.
- Palindrome  
  - A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards.  
    e.g.: "MADAM", "WOW", "KAYAK"  
- Factorial  
  - In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted
    by _n!_, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.  
    _n! = n • (n - 1) • (n - 2) • (n - 3) ... 3 • 2 • 1._  
    e.g.: _5! = 5 • 4 • 3 • 2 • 1 = 120._
